                    <p align="justify">This paper exploits a short-lived cooperation program between the U.S.S.R. and China, which led to the construction of 156 ``Million-Rouble plants'' in the 1950s. We isolate exogenous variation in location decisions due to the relative position of allied and enemy airbases and study the long-run impact of these factories on local economic activity. While the ``156'' program accelerated industrialization in treated counties until the end of the command-economy era, this significant productivity advantage fully eroded in the subsequent period. We explore the nature of local spillovers responsible for this pattern, and provide evidence that treated counties are overspecialized and far less innovative. There is a large concentration of establishments along the production chain of the Million-Rouble plants, which limits technological spillovers across industries.

                            <p align="justify">This paper provides causal evidence on the effect of rural-urban migration on urban production patterns. We use longitudinal data on Chinese manufacturing firms between 2001 and 2006, and exploit exogenous variation in rural-urban migration due to agricultural price shocks for identification. We find that following a migrant inflow, labor productivity decreases sharply and remains low in the longer run; firms adopt labor-intensive products and innovate less. Within industry and location, low-productivity firms expand the most, so that aggregate labor productivity falls even faster. We quantify the contribution of migration on productivity within a location and its dispersion across urban destinations.</p>

                            <p align="justify">This paper exploits exogenous changes in the course of the Yellow River in China as shocks to transportation costs. I assess the effect of market access, which I instrument with a measure based on exogenous course changes, on population from dynastic histories and local gazetteers spanning 2,000 years. A theoretical model allows me to characterize the relationship between trade, economic activity, and population. I find that lower transportation costs spur economic growth in the short run, but this significant productivity advantage fully dissipates in the long run. I explore the mechanisms behind this pattern and provide evidence that a large share of the decline is due to an increase in taxation. Rent extraction concentrates, with a delay, on highly productive areas, which stifles growth in the long run.</p>

                            <p align="justify">Does intergenerational cultural transmission hinder social mobility? We investigate the interaction between cultural transmission and social mobility in the contexts of China's Land Reform in the 1950s and the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. These two revolutions represent two of the most extreme episodes in human history that aim to eradicate inequality in wealth and education, to shut off formal channels of intergenerational transmission such as inheritance and schooling, and to eliminate cultural differences among the population. Using newly digitalized archival data and linked contemporary household surveys and census, we show that the revolutions were effective in homogenizing the population in one generation. However, despite the extraordinary effort to foster mobility, the intergenerational transmission of cultural values occurred anyway, and two generations later, the descendants of the pre-revolution economic elites are significantly richer and much better off today than the descendants of the pre-revolution poor.

                            <p align="justify">Migration increases sending households' capacity to invest but introduces additional information asymmetry between household members. In this paper, I establish a new stylized fact: Migrants systematically overestimate assets that they typically invest in and that are held by their households. This is shown using novel data with matched reports from Senegalese migrants and their own households of origin. I find empirical support for a self-selection mechanism: migrants are more likely to sort into investment, the more optimistic they are about their households' trustworthiness, and reject alternative interpretations based on behavioral biases. I finally assess the extent of missing investments: Selection out of investment is large and severely reduces the developmental impact of migration.</p>
